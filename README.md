# 386-BSD

<p> This is a BSD kernel from https://github.com/386Bsd/</p>
<p>and it is shared by it owner.</p>

<p> I know it may be a bad idea to restart it. But I like to try to change it and hope it can be much better. </p>
<p> IF ANY copyright problems about the kernel, please email me. MY email is jackripvim@outlook.com</p>
<p> I will make the right choice. </p>
